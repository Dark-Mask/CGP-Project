# CGP-Project - FINAL PROJECT REQUIREMENT

## Jolly Jumpers Adventure ##

### Game ###
- In this action-packed adventure, your goal is to collect the mushrooms scattered across the level while surviving without getting hit by the boss to progress to the next stage. You control a single player who must navigate through obstacles, avoid or defeat minions, and eventually face the level boss. Use W, A, S, D or arrow keys for movement, and press Space to jump over gaps and obstacles. To collect mushrooms, simply move close to them. Beware of the minions patrolling the area and the boss waiting at the end â€“ they will do everything to stop you! Keep an eye on your life bar and strategize wisely. If you need a break, press P to pause the game. Good luck!
